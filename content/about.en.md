I have been working for Neusta for over 18 years and am an experienced backend developer with a current focus on Kotlin and Spring Boot. I am also dabbling in the Go language and have an interest in IoT in my home. I am the creator of the JSF framework ButterFaces.org, although these days I am more involved in SPAs using React or Web Components.

My passion lies in creating architectures with a strong business focus. I regularly give training sessions on Domain Driven Design and hexagonal architectures, and occasionally find myself doing requirements management with Event Storming.

My name is Lars Michaelis, and I am a big fan of sharing and spreading knowledge.
