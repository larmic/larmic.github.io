Domain Driven Design (DDD for short) is an approach to modeling complex software and focuses on the technical aspects.
aspects in the foreground. The hexagonal architecture picks up on this concept and integrates the domain-oriented
content into the core of the application. The concrete technical implementation (such as database or
MQ systems) plays a subordinate role.

In this talk I motivate the implementation of software in a hexagonal architecture.
